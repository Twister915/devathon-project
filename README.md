# Devathon Project
Devathon was a competition run in 2016 where you were to make a minecraft (Bukkit) plugin that fit the theme of "machines" in 24 hours or less.

I, however, did not complete the project, because of the time constraint and the fact that I couldn't come up with anything amazing enough for me to want to make it. So... I instead created a set of utilities that are useful without dependencies. This gives me:

* A nice command system
* A nearly-reactive event system, similar to the one I wrote using RxJava
* A basic dependency injector

So yeah... hopefully this is useful to someone somewhere!
